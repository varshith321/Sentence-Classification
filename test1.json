variability in length and this has made it difficult to use it as a basis for genotypic co receptor tropism testing ", "label": "MISC"}, {"text": "nevertheless the relevance of the quest has prompted many groups to develop models that link properties of v3 to co receptor tropism ", "label": "MISC"}, {"text": "the importance of electrostatics for co receptor tropism has been recognized early on and
